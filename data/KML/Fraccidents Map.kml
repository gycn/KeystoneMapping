	<description><![CDATA[The country is in the midst of an unprecedented oil and gas drilling boom -- brought on by a controversial technology called hydraulic fracturing or "fracking." Along with this fracking-enabled oil and gas rush have come troubling reports of poisoned drinking water, polluted air, mysterious animal deaths, industrial disasters and explosions. We call them "Fraccidents." This map is a sampling of some of the high profile incidents related to the country's oil and gas drilling boom.<br><br>For more information and resources on fracking, visit Earthjustice's campaign page "Fracking Gone Wrong, Finding a Better Way":  http://earthjustice.org/fracking]]></description>

At least one incident caused fluid to spill into a creek, where a fish kill was reported. And in 2008, two separate 800-gallon diesel spills occurred in the town in June and July.	<br>Other oddities that have occurred since fracking began include: water in parts of the town turned brown and sickened residents, a creek turned red, a woman's water well exploded, and some pets and horses mysteriously lost their hair.	<br>		<br>Source: "A Colossal Fracking Mess."

The filter was changed just five days ago. (DRC / Barron Ludlum) (http://www.dentonrc.com/sharedcontent/dws/drc/localnews/stories/DRC_Filmy_Water_0606.75b6f6a3.html)	<br>Residents there have complained of an unpleasant, sulfurous stench and have reported ailments such as headaches, nausea, eye irritation and respiratory problems. The noise of the compressor stations has also ruptured several residents' ear drums.<br>An air quality study ordered by the town revealed extremely high levels of both carcinogens and neurotoxins. Of particular concern is the high levels of the carcinogen benzene detected in the air near the compressors.<br>One family's water turned gray and filled with a fine, slimy sediment after a well was dug several hundred feet from their home. The family has installed a filtration system in their home and must change the filter every four or five days due to the buildup of mysterious sediment.<br>Another resident mysteriously had one horse die and two others get sick. He blames pollution from the compressor stations.	<br>		<br>Source: "Health Issues Follow Natural Gas Drilling In Texas."

The Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry stated that the problems with the wells originated from the nearby drilling of two gas wells. Levels of “explosivity” are considered hazardous when they exceed 10%: the wells of the two homes were at 34.7% and 47.4%. The high gas levels inside and nearby the house led Columbia Gas to shut off services for a period of time because of the likelihood of an explosion.

			<description><![CDATA[In June 2012, methane from underground pathways caused plumes of gas in the air, which were found near Bradford County. Following the incident, both the state and the natural gas company investigated the cause of stray methane bubbling in streams and water wells, and found that the ground levels methane concentrations were twice the normal levels in the region’s air. Quote: "The amount of methane that had to come out at that point to generate that plume, that's a lot of methane," said Bryce Payne, Ph.D., the report's author and an environmental scientist at Gas Safety Inc. Later, Dr. Payne stated that the concentration levels posed an explosion risk.
